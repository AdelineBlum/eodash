The **Water Quality index** was designed to assess the effect of the lockdown and the subsequent recovery on inland and coastal waters by monitoring the Total Suspended Matter concentration anomaly as measured from optical sensors onboard the three agencyâ€™s satellites, namely **[Sentinel-3 (ESA)](http://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-3)**, **[GCOM-C (JAXA)](https://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/gcom_c/)** and **[Aqua (NASA)](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/aqua/)**.
