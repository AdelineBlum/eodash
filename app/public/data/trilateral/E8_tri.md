### Change in the number of new car at automobile factory

All over the world, countries have – to a greater or lesser extent – taken measures to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, such as urban lockdown or stay at home requests due to declarations of a state of emergency. Automotive industries of the world also have taken steps such as adjusting, reducing and suspending new car production. Using combined data from PALSAR-2 which is L-band SAR mounted on JAXA's ALOS-2 and C-band SAR mounted on European Sentinel-1, automobile factories and ports importing and exporting cars have been observed at high frequency globally and continuously in order to monitor the increase and decrease of new car production.

Red rectangle area in Fig 1 shows temporal changes in the density of new cars in the parking space at an automobile factory near Beijing Airport, China from December 2019 to May 2020. At the period of lockdown in Beijing from January to March 2020, the density of new cars has dropped significantly. The series of ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 images based on timeline data show that the number of new cars in the automobile factory's parking space is increasing or decreasing as well as in the number of plane and its location changes at Beijing airport.
