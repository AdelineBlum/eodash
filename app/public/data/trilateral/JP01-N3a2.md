## Water quality in Tokyo Bay

prepared by [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/) 

**Phytoplankton chlorophyll-a concentration** (Chl-a, mg/m3) can be derived from ocean colour satellite sensors. The dashboard presents an example of collaborative analysis with **[Sentinel-3/OLCI](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-olci)**, **[Aqua/MODIS](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/aqua/)**, and **[GCOM-C/SGLI](https://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/gcom_c/)** on the [North Adriatic Sea](https://www.eodashboard.org/?indicator=N3b&poi=IT6-N3b). 

The **Chl-a anomaly** is the Chl-a difference from the reference climatological values and is expressed in %. It is used as an index to assess and monitor the potential effects of the lockdown, and subsequent recovery, on inland and coastal water quality. 

Chl-a is an indicator of phytoplankton abundance which fluctuates naturally with nutrient, solar irradiance, and water temperature, and so on. In coastal areas, Chl-a is commonly used as a proxy for water quality because it is strongly influenced by river runoff and human activities, such as the discharge of urban sewage and agriculture fertilizers.

### Tokyo Bay 

The Chl-a indicator images in **Tokyo Bay** are displayed as an example of the coastal water-quality changes near the Japanese biggest cities, Tokyo, Yokohama, and Kawasaki. 

Relatively large rivers, **Arakawa**, **Sumida**, **Edogawa**, and **Tama-River** are in north and west-side of the bay. The variation ranges of the Chl-a indicators in late of March to April 2020 were similar to the ones in other months, and it was sometimes more influenced by large river outflow (e.g., around the end of March and middle-late April in 2020). That may show there is no significant influence on the coastal environment and ecosystem, even though the indicators cannot detect ones smaller than several hundred-meter scales.
