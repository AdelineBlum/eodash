## Water quality in Tokyo Bay

prepared by [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/)

**Concentrations of chlorophyll-a**  which indicate an abundance of phytoplankton in ocean waters, are often used as an indicator of inland and coastal water quality. Measured by satellites that sense ocean color, the change percentage featured here helps to assess and monitor potential affects from coronavirus-related lockdowns â€“ and subsequent recovery.

Chlorophyll-a fluctuates naturally with nutrient, solar irradiance, water temperature, and related factors. In coastal areas, it is commonly used as a proxy for water quality because it is strongly influenced by river runoff and human activities, such as the discharge of urban sewage and agriculture fertilizers.

The dashboard presents an example of collaborative analysis with **[Sentinel-3/OLCI](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-olci)**, **[Aqua/MODIS](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/aqua/)**, and **[GCOM-C/SGLI](https://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/gcom_c/)** on the [North Adriatic Sea](https://eodashboard.org/?indicator=N3b&poi=IT6-N3b).

### Tokyo Bay

The chlorophyll-a indicator images in **Tokyo Bay** are an example of the coastal water-quality changes near the biggest Japanese cities of Tokyo, Yokohama, and Kawasaki.

Relatively large rivers - **Arakawa**, **Sumida**, **Edogawa**, and **Tama-River** - are to the north and west sides of the bay. The variation in chlorophyll-a indicators in late March to April 2020 were similar to other months, and it was sometimes more influenced by large river outflow such as around the end of March and middle-late April in 2020. That may indicate the coastal environment in the Tokyo Bay is not significantly affected by the reduced activities in the term, even though the imagery cannot detect phenomena smaller than several hundred-meters.
