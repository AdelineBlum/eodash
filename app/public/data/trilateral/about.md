# Earth Observing Dashboard

### A Tri-Agency Dashboard by NASA, ESA, JAXA

International collaboration among space agencies is central to the success of satellite Earth observations and data analysis, aiming at providing an accurate and timely information to decision-makers, main stakeholders and public. These partnerships foster more comprehensive measurements, robust datasets, and cost-effective missions.

The **European Space Agency (ESA)**, **Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)**, and **National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)** have combined their resources, technical knowledge, and expertise to produce this Earth Observing Dashboard, which strengthens our understanding of the environmental and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other societal challenges impacting our planet.

The dashboard provides an easy-to-use resource for all kinds of public from the scientist to the decision-maker, including people not familiar with satellites. Based on accurate remote sensing observations, it shows how or example, how social distancing measures and regional shelter-in-place guidelines affected Earthâ€™s air, land, and water during the pandemic. The dashboard offers a precise, objective and factual view without any artifacts of our planet. You can explore countries and regions around the world to see how the indicators in specific locations changed over time.

ESA, JAXA, and NASA will continue to enhance this dashboard as new data becomes available.
