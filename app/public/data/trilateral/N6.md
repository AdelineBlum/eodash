### Examples of COVID-19 impact on Global Food Supplies

Measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 are affecting the food supply chain in many ways, including the availability of inputs, labor, transport, and cross-border trade. The GEOGLAM Crop Monitors, which were set up with the key support and participation of NASA, ESA, and JAXA, produce monthly global crop assessments using remote sensing data to help reduce uncertainty, promote market transparency, and provide early warning for crop failures through multi-agency collaboration. During the pandemic, this tool is being increasingly used in lieu of on-the-ground validation of crop conditions. 

#### Major Producing and Exporting Countries

According to satellite-based Crop Monitor assessments, current estimates indicate the global food supply is adequate. While many countries experienced lockdowns and travel bans as the novel coronavirus spread, most farmers were able to continue normal operations due to the rural nature of most farm communities and the relatively less labor intensive cultivation techniques associated with key crops.

However, the spread of COVID-19 did have an impact on governments and agricultural organizations’ ability to perform in-person field surveys of sowing, crop progress, and harvesting. This impediment reinforced the need for  strong remote sensing capabilities to augment agricultural monitoring systems. Transparent information from GEOGLAM and the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) also helped assuage global concerns and ensure the resumption of normal trade flows during the early parts of the pandemic after some large producer and export countries issued temporary trade restrictions to ensure adequate supplies for their populations. 

The Crop Monitor for AMIS assessments, covering the main grain producing and export countries, show that crop conditions and the related production for 2020 seasons are generally favourable. While dry conditions in parts of Europe, southern Ukraine, and southern Russia have impacted winter wheat yields, favourable harvests in North America, India, China, and elsewhere in the Black Sea region have offset those reductions. In the South Hemisphere, there have been good harvests of maize and soybeans in Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa. Looking ahead, conditions are favourable for most summer crops in the Northern Hemisphere, the monsoon season in India, the main rice season in northern southeast Asia, and for winter wheat in Australia. Providing evidence through satellite data that overall global production of the major staple crops is adequate has been critical during this time of uncertainty.

#### East Africa

Over the 2020 growing season in East Africa, agricultural production has faced the triple threat of desert locusts, deadly flooding and COVID-19 impacts.

The overall impact of the pandemic on agricultural production of major grains within the region so far has been generally limited, and supplies of staple foods are reported to be sufficient. However, production has been disrupted in some areas through COVID-19 restrictions, causing agricultural labor supply shortages and disrupting input supply chains, limiting farmers’ access to seeds, fertilizers, and other inputs. This has already resulted in reported declines in planted area and yields in Ethiopia, Somalia and elsewhere across the region, and it will be critical to continue to monitor the situation and to provide timely and evidence driven crop assessments.

#### Southeast Asia

In Southern Asia, the GEOGLAM crop condition assessments are coordinated by the Asian Rice Crop Estimation & Monitoring (Asia-RiCE) initiative led by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) with inputs from the region’s national ministries of agriculture.. COVID-19 has impacted the region by restricting the ability of governments to do field surveys, particularly during the height of the outbreak.

Currently, on the northern side of Southeast Asia, the dry-season rice has come to a close and the wet-season rice (main producing season)  is underway. The dry season which ended in May/June was impacted by persistent dry conditions that drove down yields and planted area in Myanmar, Thailand, and Laos. On the other hand, the wet-season rice began under generally favourable conditions with ample rainfall in most areas except for southern Vietnam. Additionally, there has been some flooding in Bangladesh.

In the southern side (Indonesia), the wet-season rice is complete and the dry-season rice is underway. During the wet-season, reduced rainfall delayed the sowing of the rice and eventually resulted in less total sown area and a reduction in yields. As a consequence of the delay in the wet-season, the sowing of dry-season rice was delayed. Despite the delay, good rainfall has continued into the traditional dry-season.
