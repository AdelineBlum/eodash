## Port of Dunkirk (France) - Nightlights
 

The Port of Dunkirk is the third-largest maritime port in northern France. Located on the busy North Sea, the port is well known for the comings and goings of heavy cargo barges. In early March, following French government guidance, the port began to limit activity in response to the novel coronavirus. Researchers are using night lights to track variations in energy use, migration, and transportation at the port in response to social distancing and lockdown measures. They are able to visualize the extent social distancing measures impacted various economic activities based on whether light pollution increased or decreased, which highways were shut down, and which cities stayed the same.
