The **Water Quality index** was designed to assess the effect of the lockdown and the subsequent recovery on inland and coastal waters by monitoring the deviation from a climatological mean of Chlorophyll-a (Chl) concentration as measured from optical sensors onboard the three agencyâ€™s satellites, namely **[Sentinel-3 (ESA)](http://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-3)**, **[GCOM-C (JAXA)](https://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/gcom_c/)** and **[Aqua (NASA)](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/aqua/)**.

Chlorophyll-a concentration is an indicator of algae abundance, which fluctuates naturally over space and time, as a result of combined atmospheric and oceanic effects (e.g., marine currents and upwelling). In coastal areas, strongly influenced by river inputs and human activities, high Chl concentration can result from the discharge of urban sewage, industrial runoffs, and fertilizers from agriculture activities over watersheds. In particular, nutrient inputs of anthropogenic origin affect the natural amount of phytoplankton in marine and inland waters, representing a continuous threat to biodiversity and leading to undesirable modifications of phytoplankton concentration (i.e., eutrophication).
