## Parking situation of airplanes at airport 

Indicator provided by: [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/) based on data provided by [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/) and [ESA](https://esa.int)

During the urban lockdown or stay at home requests periods, human activities including movement are rapidly decreasing. This occasion might be affected to airlines operations i.e. many flights have been canceled.

### Change in the number of airplane at parking areas in airports 

Using combined data from PALSAR-2 which is L-band SAR mounted on JAXA's ALOS-2 and C-band SAR mounted on European Sentinel-1, the temporal changes of the parking situation at airports have been captured that might be correlated with operation of airlines. In general, artificial targets such as buildings, cars, airplanes are brighter like a “point target” than natural targets such as bare lands, ocean, forest areas in SAR image. 

Figure 1 shows a color composited image at Tokyo International Airport, Haneda by PALSAR-2 acquired on Nov. 28, 2019 assigned as red color, Mar. 19, 2020 as green, and May 14, 2020 as blue, respectively. For example, white colored areas such as buildings indicate no brightness changes during the period, individual red, green, or blue colored pixels in parking areas of the airport indicate airplanes at that time, cyan colored areas that show airplanes on March and May 2020 in Fig. 1.
