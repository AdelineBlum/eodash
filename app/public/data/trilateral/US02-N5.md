## Los Angeles (USA) - Nightlights

During the COVID-19 pandemic researchers are using nightlight observations to track variations in energy use, migration, and transportation in response to social distancing and lockdown measures. Each spotlight city has a slider for turning night lights on and off. By comparing regions before and after guidelines to shelter-in-place began, researchers visualize the extent to which social distancing measures affected various economic activities based on whether light pollution increased or decreased, which highways were shut down, and which cities stayed the same.
