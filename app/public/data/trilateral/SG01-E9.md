Indicator provided by: [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/) based on data provided by [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/) and [ESA](https://esa.int)

Using combined data from PALSAR-2 which is L-band SAR mounted on JAXA's ALOS-2 and C-band SAR mounted on European Sentinel-1,  at container terminal at ports importing and exporting cars and moving containers have been observed at high frequency globally and continuously in order to monitor the change.

### Change in the number of new car / containers at container terminal

Temporal changes in the density of new cars and containers at the container terminal such as “Tanjong Pagar Terminal” in Singapore port are monitored from January to May 2020 shown in Figure 2 using Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2.

Figure 3 and 4 shows car and container density change graph derived from time series SAR data in Tanjong Pagar Terminal and Keepel terminal area at the port of Singapore. Figure 3 shows the density of car / containers dropping from the end of April in Tanjong Pagar Terminal.  Based on government announcement of Singapore, because a large facility is being set up at Tanjong Pagar Terminal to potentially house Covid-19 patients and foreign workers, as the number of coronavirus cases in Singapore continues to increase. This mega temporary structure could accommodate up to 15,000 people.
