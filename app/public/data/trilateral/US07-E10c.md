## Early Rice Planting in Sacramento, California, USA

### Monitoring rice planting progress  

Global food supply is a major challenge in the best conditions. COVID-19 has strained the food supply and demand balance by disrupting food supply chain systems, such as labor, logistics, trade/domestic policies, and market anxiety.  In the case of rice production, COVID-19 contributed to concerns over global supply through potential increases in demand, threats of export restrictions, and farm labor concerns. These and other factors resulted in a reported increase in global rice production.

For decades satellite monitoring for global food supply has provided critical, independent, and objective indicators of major commodity supplies, and it continues during the COVID19 crisis. Satellite imagery is able to confirm planting progress in key rice producing areas. Satellite imagery are used to assess the state of planting near Sacramento, California, USA, using ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and GCOM-C operated by JAXA, Sentinel-2 by ESA, and Landsat-8 by NASA/USGS. These satellites can capture rice phenology, when rice is planted, mature and harvested, through the observation of land surface conditions such as water inundation for planting and leaf area after emergence.

Satellite observations show that the rice planting this year began earlier than the past two years in many regions (Fig.1, 2,3,4). Early assessments of planting progress allow agriculture markets to respond efficiently to supply disruptions due to natural (e.g. weather, pandemics) and man-made events(e.g. trade policy changes).

*Figure 1. Study Area (Colusa, Glenn, and Yoro counties in CA, USA). Background is Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery generated from the data observed by GCOM-C SGLI during March 5-12 2020. NDVI represents the amount of leaves of vegetation. NDVI ranges from -1 to 1, high value means high density of green leaves.*

Yellow lines (2020) go up earlier than red (2019) or blue (2018), this implies that rice panting and growing in 2020 is earilest among last three years.*
