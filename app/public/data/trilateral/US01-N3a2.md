## Water quality in New York

On March 22, New York state, at the time the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, set mandatory stay-at-home restrictions in an attempt to slow the spread. These restrictions are expected to dramatically alter the quantity and location of nutrient inputs to Long Island Sound. Data from the moderate-resolution imagers onboard the NASA Aqua, U.S. Geological Survey-NASA Landsat 8, and European Space Agency Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites reflect changes in Long Island Sound and New York Harbor water quality indicators (chlorophyll-a and sediment) following quarantine restrictions. Chlorophyll-a is an indicator for nutrient levels and algae growth; the amount of sediment in the water reflects how murky or clear it is. Anomalies presented here reflect highly variable physical and ecological dynamics of Long Island Sound, and potential effects from stay-at-home restrictions. More work is ongoing to assess the main factors driving these changes.
