## CMEMS Chl maps 

Chl is the phytoplankton chlorophyll concentration, an indicator of algae abundance. The CMEMS Ocean Colour Thematic Assembly Center (OC-TAC), produce and distributes for the Mediterranean sea daily interpolated chlorophyll field with no data voids starting from the multi-sensor (MODIS-Aqua, NOAA-20-VIIRS, NPP-VIIRS, Sentinel3A-OLCI) at 1 km resolution. Chlorophyll field are obtained by means of the Mediterranean regional algorithm, which applies two different approaches for Open Ocean and coastal waters. The data are then merged into a single chlorophyll field providing a regional product with an improved accuracy of estimates across the basin. The daily interpolated gap-free Level-4 Chl concentration is estimated by means of an iterative procedure in which Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) are used to reconstruct the entire field domain.

### More information about CMEMS

The Copernicus Marine Service (or Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service) is the marine component of the Copernicus Programme of the European Union. It provides free, regular and systematic authoritative information on the state of the Blue (physical), White (sea ice) and Green (biogeochemical) ocean, on a global and regional scale. It is funded by the European Commission (EC) and implemented by Mercator Ocean International. It is designed to serve EU policies and International legal Commitments related to Ocean Governance, to cater for the needs of society at large for global ocean knowledge and to boost the Blue Economy across all maritime sectors by providing free-of-charge state-of-the-art ocean data and information.

It provides key inputs that support major EU and international policies and initiatives and can contribute to: combating pollution, marine protection, maritime safety and routing, sustainable use of ocean resources, developing marine energy resources, blue growth, climate monitoring, weather forecasting, and more. It also aims to increase awareness amongst the general public by providing European and global citizens with information about ocean-related issues.
