## GCOM-C Ocean net primary productivity (ONPP)

Net primary productivity [mgC/m<sup>2</sup>/day] is gross photosynthetic carbon fixation minus the carbon respired to support maintenance requirements of the whole plant.

JAXA's GCOM-C mission aims to establish and demonstrate a global, long-term satellite-observing system to measure essential geophysical parameters to facilitate understanding the global radiation budget and carbon cycle mechanism, and eventually contribute to improving future climate projection through a collaborative framework with climate model institutions.
