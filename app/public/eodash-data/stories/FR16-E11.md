## Disneyland Paris park empty during French lockdown due to Covid 19

The Covid-19 pandemic has strongly impacted leisure industry: theme parks, museums, zoos and aquariums were all closed during the lockdown.
The Walt Disney company reports 1 billion U.S $ reduction in operating income in 2020 Q2. Disneyland Paris reopened on July 15 after a four-month closure due to COVID-19, but with face masks and social distancing required. With a limited daily capacity and many precaution measures, the leisure sector of activity is slowly picking up.
