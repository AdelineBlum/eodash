## Oil tanks in Rotterdam, Netherlands

#### Oil storages filling up as demand for oil decreases when people are not travelling

Oil sector has been facing a sudden decline in demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As oil prices dropped below zero for the first time in April 2020, storage tanks had never been so full. Rotterdam harbour is the european leader in oil storage, and the tanks' filling level can be observed on ICEYE imagery. In July, tanks were still very full.
