# EO Dashboard Hackathon 
### 23-29 June 2021

## Summary

During a week-long event, from 23 - 29 June 2021, participants create virtual teams and solve one of 10 challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic using data from the [Earth Observing Dashboard](https://eodashboard.org) (the “EO Dashboard” for short). 

The EO Dashboard Hackathon official page: [https://www.eodashboardhackathon.org/](https://www.eodashboardhackathon.org/)

The challenges ask participants to consider the environmental, social, and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic using data from NASA, ESA, and JAXA on the Earth Observing Dashboard. The following categories align with the “Indicators” displayed on the Dashboard.

Happy Hacking!

## Categories

 * Air Quality - The COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting social distancing recommendations and related restrictions have led to numerous short-term changes in economic and social activity around the world, all of which may have impacts on air quality.
 * Water Quality - Challenges in this Indicator category will ask you to use space-based data to document water quality changes caused by COVID-19 and the associated societal responses.
 * Economic Impact - Challenges in this Indicator category will ask you to integrate various Earth Observations with available socioeconomic data in order to discover or enhance our understanding of COVID-19 impacts.
 * Interconnected Earth System Impact - Challenges in this Indicator category will ask you to determine how changes in human behavior related to COVID-19 have interconnected impacts on the Earth system.
 * Agricultural Impact - Challenges in this Indicator category deal with the COVID-19-related risks of disruptions to agriculture, including supply chains and logistics, that could impact food security in a region or globally.
 * Interactive Data Exploration - Challenges in this category will ask you to fuse/merge different Earth Observation products into single meaningful views that can provide more insights than the individual products viewed separately.
