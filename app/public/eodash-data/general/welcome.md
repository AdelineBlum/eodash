### Dashboard Challenges 2021

The purpose of the Rapid Action on Covid-19 and EO (RACE) Dashboard Challenges is to get participants engaged with the Dashboard, its data, and computational resources, so they can use them together with other EO and non-EO data to develop new ways of monitoring the impacts of the pandemic. 

With each challenge we aim to discover new indicators, contributed by the community, to be integrated into this dashboard. 

Two community-contributed indicators from the 2020 COVID19 scripting contest can be currently explored on the RACE Dashboard: [trucks traffic](https://race.esa.int/?poi=W2-E12c&indicator=E12c) and [airplane traffic](https://race.esa.int/?poi=UK8-E13d&indicator=E13d).

The next round of challenges opens on 1 September 2021.
